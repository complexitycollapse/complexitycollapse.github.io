# Teletext Notes

40x24 characters. Each character 12x20. Characters stored as 5x9 then interpolated to give a 10x18 character. Additional pixels on the top and left were blank.

Characters generated by (clone of) Signetics 2513. There were also "block characters", basically every combination of 2x3 bits. This doesn't fit into 12x20 though so the mille blocks were 8px high and the others 6px. Also supported £ 	$ 	@ 	← 	½ 	→ 	↑ 	#/⌗ 	─ 	¼ 	‖ 	¾ 	÷

Control characters: set foreground and background colour (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, flash), character size (double height, double width or both), current character set.
