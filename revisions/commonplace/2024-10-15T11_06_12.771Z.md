# Commonplace

Commonplace is an attempt at building the world's first and only *true* hypertext system. What's a true hypertext system? It's a world-spanning information management system as described by Ted Nelson, the originator of the word *hypertext*. Rather than simply imitate paper on a screen, as current computer information systems do (word processors, PDFs, web *pages*) a true hypertext system embraces the concept of *nonlinearity*. A document isn't a linear presentation of data, but a multi-dimensional, multi-perspectival object that is deeply interlinked within itself and with the universe of all other such documents (the *docuverse*). It is everything the web was supposed to be, but failed to be. It is the web's replacement.

And it's really, really hard to understand. Not because it's complicated - in fact it's almost trivial compared to the monstrosity of the current World Wide Web - but because the concepts required to understand it are so strange and alien that it's nearly impossible for people to grasp. But as Ted Nelson said - once people see it in action, they will understand it *immediately*.
