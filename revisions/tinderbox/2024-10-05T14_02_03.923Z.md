# Tinderbox

Tinderbox is a visual knowledge management/note taking application inspired by things like zettelkasten and mind maps. Arguably it's a hypertext system. Either way its exactly what I want my hypertext system to do.

## How it works

There is a notes field on the left and a text area on the right. *Notes* have a title, text and can contain other notes. Notes visually change if they have contents (you can see the contents in some circumstances). Notes containing other notes are known as containers.

Notes *link* to other notes. Each note has a list of incoming and outgoing links.

Notes have *attributes*, which allow them to act like records. Each note has a set of visible attributes, but it theoretically has every attribute in the system. Attributes are sorted into categories to make them manageable. There are system attributes, some of which are read-only. All the visual styling is done through attributes.

You can choose from different *views*. 

 - The map view shows notes spacially arranged.
 - Outline view shows the hierarchy of notes. It looks very much like a standard highlighting tool.
 - more...

You can double-click on a note to change the view to what it contains. There are breadcrumbs along the top that let you know where you are.

You can create *prototypes* which act as templates for other notes. You can change the prototype of an existing note. I think prototypes are nothing more than notes that you keep in the prototype container. (No, there's a prototype property you can set, but perhaps notes created in the prototypes container have that set by default). You can reset a note so that it is restored to the state of the prototype. This resets the list of attributes but not things like the title or text. (Are prototypes a superior alternative to templates in Commonplace?)

## Good Points

 - Notes are visual yet abstract. Every note has many different visual representations, depending on the view used.
 - Hierarchical notes allows any note to grow to unlimited complexity.
 - Multiple visual views (overlays?) on the same data.
 - Notes have two kinds of "contents", the text within them and the notes they contain.
 - Notes have different kinds of relations to ther notes. For example, the spacial arrangement in the map view vs. the ordering in the outline view.
