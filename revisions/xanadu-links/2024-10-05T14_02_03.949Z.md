# Xanadu Links

Finding out information about Xanadu on the web is really hard. For some reason, nobody who works with Xanadu, past or present, ever thought that hypertext would be a good medium for describing how it works! The search engines are also really bad at surfacing information on these topics (the big search engines have completely given up on indexing the web and are now just tools for finding someone's Twitter handle or a corporation's website). So here's my hard-won list of Xanadu stuff found online.

## Start Here

There are no good explanations of Xanadu on the web, but here are the best.

 - [Xanadu Basics playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMKy52Intac&list=PL_VPHE35-pxem4YDQVsvfdlxu1lLZXGDW) - Recommended
 - [Xanalogical Structure, Needed Now More than Ever](https://www.xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html)
 - [The Mother of All Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) - the first ever working hypertext system (and the most important tech demo of all time).

## Semi-Official Xanadu Sites:

 - http://xanadu.com - surprisingly useless website. There's a lot of stuff here but it's mostly impossible to find.
 - https://www.xanadu.com.au/ - much better than xanadu.com, and repeats a lot of its content.
 - http://udanax.xanadu.com/ - a backup of udanax.com. Hosts the open source versions of Ted Nelson's original Xanadu systems.
 - http://www.thetednelson.com/ - Ted Nelson's homepage.
 - https://www.youtube.com/@TheTedNelson - Ted Nelson's YouTube channel. Possibly the best single source of information for a beginner.
 - http://hyperland.com/ - an older homepage of Ted Nelson's.

## Xanadu History and Technology
 - [Sunless Sea](https://web.archive.org/web/20111015115904/http://www.sunless-sea.net/wiki2) - archive of the "Xanadu cyberarcheology project", which hosted original Xanadu documentation and historical information about the various Xanadu projects.
 - [Hyperworlds](http://hyperworlds.org/) - compendium of hypermedia links.

## Xanadu.com Links

Because it's impossible to find stuff on that website, I've curated a few highlights.

 - [THE XANADUÂ® PARALLEL UNIVERSE](https://xanadu.com/xUniverse-D6) - list of 'recent' Xanadu projects.
 - [CosmicBook](https://xanadu.com/cosmicbook/index.html) - a readonly Xanadu implementation.
 - [Open Xanadu demo](https://www.xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html) - a web-based Xanadu. (Takes a while to load)
 - [Old Ted Nelson Homepage](https://xanadu.com.au/ted/)
 - [Floating World](https://xanadu.com/zigzag/fw99/) - another Xanadu implementation, with added ZigZag.
 - https://xanadu.com/zigzag/fw99/ZZcellProg.html -  programming with ZigZag.
 - [XanaduSpace](https://xanadu.com/xuspViewer.html) - has a 3D interface.

## Wikipedia
 - [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) - not a particularly accurate article.
 - [Enfilade_(Xanadu)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfilade_(Xanadu)) - a data structure designed for representing hypermedia documents.
 - [ZigZag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigZag_(software)) - another project by Nelson. Not Xanadu but the ideas are inspirational.

## Enfilades and Ents

Enfilades are a data structure proposed as a means of storing and manipulating Xanadu documents in an efficient way. They are a kind of (binary?) tree that can share structure with other trees, allowing Xanadu documents to share structure with each other. Although they were very important to the early Xanadu implementations, it's not clear whether they have any relevance today, when computers are more powerful, or whether they are compatible with more modern ideas, such as permascrolls.

Ents are an even more advanced (and complicated) variation on enfilades.
