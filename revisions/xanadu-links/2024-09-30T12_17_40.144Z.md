# Xanadu Links

Finding out information about Xanadu on the web is really hard. For some reason, nobody who works with Xanadu, past or present, ever thought that hypertext would be a good medium for describing how it works! The search engines are also really bad a surfacing information on these topics (the big search engines have completely given up on indexing the web and are now just tools for finding someone's Twitter handle or a corporation's website). So here's my hard-won list of Xanadu stuff found online.

## Start Here

There are no good explanations of Xanadu on the web, but here are the best.

 - [Xanadu Basics playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMKy52Intac&list=PL_VPHE35-pxem4YDQVsvfdlxu1lLZXGDW) - Recommended
 - [Xanalogical Structure, Needed Now More than Ever](https://www.xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html)
 - [The Mother of All Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) - the first ever working hypertext system (and the most important tech demo of all time).

## Semi-Official Xanadu Sites:

 - http://xanadu.com - surprisingly useless website. There's a lot of stuff here but it's mostly impossible to find.
 - https://www.xanadu.com.au/ - much better than xanadu.com, and repeats a lot of its content.
 - http://udanax.xanadu.com/ - a backup of udanax.com. Hosts the open source versions of Ted Nelson's original Xanadu systems.
 - http://www.thetednelson.com/ - Ted Nelson's homepage.
 - https://www.youtube.com/@TheTedNelson - Ted Nelson's YouTube channel. Possibly the best single source of information for a beginner.
 - http://hyperland.com/ - an older homepage of Ted Nelson's.

## Xanadu History and Technology
 - [Sunless Sea](https://web.archive.org/web/20111015115904/http://www.sunless-sea.net/wiki2) - archive of the "Xanadu cyberarcheology project", which hosted original Xanadu documentation and historical information about the various Xanadu projects.
 - [Hyperworlds](http://hyperworlds.org/) - compendium of hypermedia links.

## Xanadu.com Links

Because it's impossible to find stuff on that website, I've curated a few highlights.

 - [CosmicBook](https://xanadu.com/cosmicbook/index.html) - a readonly Xanadu implementation.
 - [Open Xanadu demo](https://www.xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html) - a web-based Xanadu. (Takes a while to load)
 - [Old Ted Nelson Homepage](https://xanadu.com.au/ted/)
 - [Floating World](https://xanadu.com/zigzag/fw99/) - another Xanadu implementation, with added ZigZag.
 - https://xanadu.com/zigzag/fw99/ZZcellProg.html -  programming with ZigZag.


## Wikipedia
 - [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) - not a particularly accurate article.
 - [Enfilade_(Xanadu)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfilade_(Xanadu)) - a data structure designed for representing hypermedia documents.
 - [ZigZag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigZag_(software)) - another project by Nelson. Not Xanadu but the ideas are inspirational.

## Other Hypermedia Systems
 - [Hypertext Editing System (HES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Editing_System) - One of Ted's first projects.
 - [FRESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Retrieval_and_Editing_System)
 - [Intermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia_(hypertext)) - allegedly this was a good one.
 - [NoteCards](https://ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics227-SQ04/papers/Hypertext/Secondary/p836-halasz.pdf) - includes a great discussion of issues around hypertext.
 - [NLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) - Doug Engelbart's hypertext system.
 - [Hyperscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK1xOOJH-Cw) - Produced by the Doug Engelbart Institute.
