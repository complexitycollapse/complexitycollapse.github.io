<p>Here are some requirements for a true hypertext system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support linear documents that can be read from beginning to end</li>
<li>Allow hierarchical structures that can be navigated logically (e.g. via a table of contents) or linearly (reading from start to finish)</li>
<li>Support non-linear documents that can be navigated in almost any fashion imaginable (essentially graphs)</li>
<li>Allow a document to have <em>multiple</em> of the aforementioned structures <em>simultaneously</em></li>
<li>Make the document dynamic (without a scripting language) so these structures can be transformed by the user in a controlled fashion</li>
<li>Interlink documents so that you can navigate <em>between</em> them (and parts of them) arbitrarily</li>
<li>Allow documents to be seen from different <em>perspectives</em>, each one arranging the information in a different way for a different purpose</li>
<li>Allow the user to view, navigate and edit the document via any one of these structures or perspectives, or via a perspective of their own making</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, as you start from the top of this list, a hypertext document seems like a reasonably solid thing. But as you work your way down, it becomes progressively lessâ€¦ objective. It starts becoming ever more fluid, ever more subjective, until by the end it's like nothing at all. It has no solidity anymore.</p>
<p>How on earth do you explain that to a computer?</p>
<p>This is a question with a long history and many previous answers. One of those answers even has its own Wikipedia entry (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfilade_(Xanadu)">Enfilade (Xanadu)</a>). </p>
<p>One thing is clear - absolutely nothing like this exists at present in any application or computing system. Every structure or datatype of existing programming languages is unsuited to the task. A hierarchy is no good. An object graph is no good. A relational database is no good.</p>
<p>But it only has to be implemented once, and then everyone will be able to use it.</p>
